## Gameplay:
Explore ‘The World of Fes’ through 4 mini games: The Maze of Fes, Draft Breaker, Fairydust Collector, and last but not least Wing Hunt!
 

**The Maze of Fes:** Navigate the Maze to collect trinkets, colliding in walls will end the game.
 

**Crate Breaker:** Use the magic boulder to break the quickly encroaching blocks to help defend Fes’ world. This game follows the popular base game model, brick breaker. _**incomplete**_

​
**Fairydust Collector:** Collect as much fairy dust as possible using Fes’ bag. This mini game is modeled using the mechanisms of the game built in assignment one of the course. The speed will increase as the game progresses. The game is over when the wrong item (an acorn) is caught.
 

**Wing Hunt!:** Help Fes retrieve her missing wings by running through the mystical world,  avoiding obstacles such as flying objects and bosses, jump to elevated platforms and find Fes’ wings at the end of the second level.
